        <p class="box2">A car, also known as an automobile, is a self-propelled motor vehicle primarily used for
            passenger
            transportation
            on land. It typically has four wheels and is powered by an engine, most commonly an internal combustion
            engine
            fueled by gasoline. Cars are a ubiquitous part of modern technology, manufactured on a large scale and used
            worldwide. </p>

        <p class="box4">JDM, short for Japanese Domestic Market, refers to vehicles and parts exclusively designed for
            the Japanese
            market, adhering to its unique regulations and standards. While JDM cars are not just sold in Japan, but
            also to other countries, true JDM vehicles are those initially intended only for the Japanese market. These
            cars often feature unique styling, engine options, and features tailored to the Japanese consumer, and
            they've gained immense popularity and a strong following globally, especially among enthusiasts. </p>

            La Liga action will continue on Sunday as old enemies Barcelona and Real Madrid clash at the Estadi Olimpic
            Lluis Companys in a huge match in the title race.

            The Catalan giants would almost confirm their new status as champions with victory this weekend, while Real
            would open the title race wide open if they manage to come away with full points. </p>

        <p class="f4">Barcelona made the worst possible start to the game when Wojciech Szczęsny brought down Kylian
            Mbappe and conceded a penalty. Mbappe duly converted the spot-kick to make it 1-0 after just three minutes.

            Another goal wasn’t too far away. Lamine Yamal claimed to have been fouled after losing the ball but Madrid
            simply played on and worked the ball through to Mbappe to make it 2-0 with only 14 minutes on the clock.

            Barcelona were in all sorts of trouble at that point but roared back in spectacular style. Eric Garcia gave
            the hosts hope when he headed in a corner, before Yamal curled home an exquisite shot to level it up.

            And then it was over to Raphinha. Barca’s brilliant Brazilian was sent through on goal and slotted home
            comfortably to put the hosts ahead for the first time in the match. He then pounced on a mistake to make it
            4-2 just before half-time to extend Barca’s lead.</p>
