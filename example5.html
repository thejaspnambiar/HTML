    <p style="color: burlywood;"> stands for "Japanese Domestic Market," referring to vehicles and parts designed
        and intended for the
        Japanese
        market only. While the term technically refers to vehicles sold within Japan, it has expanded to encompass a
        broader culture and aesthetic that embraces performance, styling, and ingenuity, resonating far beyond
        Japanese
        borders. JDM cars are highly regarded for their engineering, design, and the strong culture built around
        them,
        with many enthusiasts and collectors seeking out these vehicles and parts for their unique characteristics.
